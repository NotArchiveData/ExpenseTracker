<!-- Remember to add "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />" this line of code to ./android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml!!!! -->

to do

Functions
- add a reload, drag from top to refresh transactions
- undo last transaction
- swipe to reveal delete button and then delete transactions ( confirmation on it )
- last item in the list of transactions will be an option that takes you directly to the spreadsheet!!
- pressing a button immediately takes you to type
- icon on the top right can be voice input lol

UI
- + and - buttons are weird
- text limit for entries
- when there are lots of entries, the gap between the end and the buttons is too little
- when the entry list goes out of the box, make a cool fade or something visual rather than just abruptly cutting it off
- detailed transaction on tap, opens up to a bigger menu or animate tile into full view smth smth
- inner shadow on the cards and buttons to add that extra coolness
