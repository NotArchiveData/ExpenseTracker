to do

urgent
- reloading icon colour is to be changed.
- make sure to replace the code in the main.dart file to add the white icons at the top and buttom
- finally, clean up the code. make things smoother, and, remove unnecessary things. 

Future Updates:
Functions
- maybe add another field asking for location. like: amount, to, items, at(location)
- going into negatives is illegal?

UI
- popup transaction "enter" and "cancel" buttons' pressed highlights arent rounded. you can see a small little corner sticking out
- maybe put some nice indicator for add funds and subtract funds, it looks too empty and almost incomplete. 
- the highlighted button is a rounded rectangle with a different colour which doesnt match the UI. try fixing that
- try to make the app smoother, seems to be a bit laggy? maybe just an emulator thing but check
- x at the end of text boxes to clear entries
- inner shadow on the cards and buttons to add that extra coolness
