to do

Functions
- swipe to reveal delete button and then delete transactions ( confirmation on it )
- pressing a button immediately takes you to type
- going into negatives is illegal?
- cannot enter empty values for subtract or add

UI
- more details displays a thinner box when theres less text to show. make the width of the popup be the max it can 
- try to make the app smoother, seems to be a bit laggy? maybe just an emulator thing but check
- x at the end of text boxes to clear entries
- inner shadow on the cards and buttons to add that extra coolness

Final changes
- front loading page
- app icon
- sounds you want to add, could be cool
