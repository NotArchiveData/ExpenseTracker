<!-- Remember to add "<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />" this line of code to ./android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml!!!! -->

to do

Functions
- add a reload, drag from top to refresh transactions

UI
- + and - buttons are weird
- text limit for entries
- when there are lots of entries, the gap between the end and the buttons is too little
- when the entry list goes out of the box, make a cool fade or something visual rather than just abruptly cutting it off
